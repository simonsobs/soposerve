"""
A simple SOPO server example. This runs with uvicorn,
and serves the web frontend at http://localhost:8000/web.
Containers for Mongo and Minio are provided through
testcontainers; the same patterns are used in testing.
Additionally, you will want to turn off "debug",
"create_test_user", and any other non-production settings.

Once you've started up your server, you can use
the simpleupload.py script to upload any example
products. You should be able to download them and
view their metadata through the web frontend.
